## Connectivity

**Purpose:** Test connectivity to a Windows Server and establish a PowerShell remoting session. This is typically the first skill to run before any diagnostics.

### What It Checks

- **Ping (ICMP)** — Is the server reachable on the network?
- **WinRM** — Is PowerShell remoting enabled and responding?
- **Authentication** — Can we execute commands with current or provided credentials?
- **CIM session** — Can we establish a CIM session for WMI data?

### Triggers

- _"Can you reach server01?"_
- _"Test connectivity to server01"_
- _"Is server01 online?"_

### Common Failures

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Access is denied | Insufficient permissions | Use account with local admin rights |
| Cannot be resolved | DNS/name resolution failure | Check hostname, try IP address |
| WinRM cannot process | WinRM not enabled | Run `Enable-PSRemoting -Force` on target |
| Connection timed out | Firewall blocking | Check port 5986 (HTTPS) |
| Logon failure | Bad credentials | Verify username/password |

---

## Server Overview

**Purpose:** Get a high-level overview of the target server — hostname, OS version, uptime, domain membership, and basic hardware info.

### What It Checks

- OS name, version, build number, architecture
- Hostname, FQDN, domain membership, domain role
- Last boot time and uptime
- Hardware: manufacturer, model, RAM, CPU count
- BIOS information

### Triggers

- _"What is going on with server01?"_
- _"Give me an overview of server01"_
- _"Check server01"_ (general)

### Key Thresholds

| Metric | Good | Warning | Critical |
|--------|------|---------|----------|
| Uptime | 7–60 days | 60–90 days | >90 days (missing patches) or <1 day (frequent reboots) |

{: .note }
> Uptime >90 days typically means the server is missing Windows Updates that require a reboot.

---

## Disk Storage

**Purpose:** Analyze disk storage including volume space, disk health, SMART data, large files, and I/O performance.

### What It Checks

- **Volume space** — Size, used, free, percent free per drive
- **Physical disks** — Health status, media type, bus type
- **SMART data** — Temperature, read/write errors, power-on hours
- **Large files/folders** — Top space consumers for cleanup
- **Disk I/O** — Read/write latency, queue length

### Triggers

- _"server01 is out of disk space"_
- _"What can I delete on server01?"_
- _"Check disk health on server01"_

### Space Thresholds

| Free Space | Status | Action |
|------------|--------|--------|
| >20% | 🟢 Healthy | Monitor regularly |
| 10–20% | 🟡 Warning | Plan cleanup or expansion |
| 5–10% | 🔴 Critical | Immediate action needed |
| <5% | 🔴 Emergency | System may become unstable |

### I/O Performance

| Metric | SSD Good | HDD Good | Problem |
|--------|----------|----------|---------|
| Read Latency | <10 ms | <15 ms | >50 ms |
| Write Latency | <10 ms | <15 ms | >50 ms |
| Queue Length | <1 | <2 | >5 |

---

## Performance

**Purpose:** Collect real-time performance metrics — CPU, memory, disk I/O, and network throughput — with optional continuous sampling.

### What It Checks

- **CPU** — Utilization %, processor queue length
- **Memory** — Total/used/free, percent used, page faults/sec, pages/sec
- **Disk** — Reads/writes per second, latency, queue length
- **Network** — Bytes sent/received, Mbps throughput

### Triggers

- _"server01 is slow"_
- _"Get baseline performance on server01"_
- _"What's using resources on server01?"_

### CPU Thresholds

| Metric | Healthy | Warning | Critical |
|--------|---------|---------|----------|
| % Processor Time | <70% | 70–90% | >90% |
| Processor Queue | <2 per core | 2–5 per core | >5 per core |

### Memory Thresholds

| Metric | Healthy | Warning | Critical |
|--------|---------|---------|----------|
| Available Memory | >20% of total | 10–20% | <10% |
| Pages/sec | <100 | 100–500 | >500 |

{: .warning }
> **Pages/sec >100** indicates memory pressure — the system is swapping to disk, which severely impacts performance.

---

## Processes

**Purpose:** Analyze running processes — identify top CPU and memory consumers, detect hung applications, and spot anomalies.

### What It Checks

- Total process count and aggregate memory usage
- **Top 10 CPU consumers** with process details
- **Top 10 memory consumers** with handle/thread counts
- Processes with high handle count (>10,000) — potential resource leak
- Processes with high thread count (>100) — potential deadlock
- Hung/not responding processes (GUI apps)
- Process search by name pattern

### Triggers

- _"What's using CPU on server01?"_
- _"server01 is slow — what process is the cause?"_
- _"Is w3wp running on server01?"_

### Warning Signs

| Indicator | Possible Issue |
|-----------|---------------|
| Process count >500 | Runaway process spawning |
| Unknown process >50% CPU | Malware or misconfiguration |
| High handle count (>10k) | Resource leak |
| Processes in Temp folders | Potential malware |
| Misspelled system processes | Malware (e.g., "svch0st.exe") |

---

## Services

**Purpose:** Analyze Windows services — status, startup type, crashes, dependencies, and services that should be running but aren't.

### What It Checks

- Total service count (running, stopped, disabled)
- **Auto-start services that aren't running** — potential crashes or failures
- Recent service crash events (Event IDs 7031, 7034)
- Service dependencies (what depends on what)
- Services running with custom/privileged accounts

### Triggers

- _"Is SQL running on server02?"_

---

## Network

**Purpose:** Analyze network configuration — adapters, IP config, DNS, open ports, firewall rules, and connectivity tests.

### What It Checks

- **Network adapters** — Status, IP, DNS, gateway, link speed, DHCP
- **Listening ports** — What's listening and which process owns it
- **Established connections** — Active TCP connections
- **DNS resolution** — Can the server resolve hostnames?
- **Connectivity tests** — Ping + port tests to target hosts
- **Firewall rules** — Enabled inbound/outbound rules

### Triggers

- _"When was server01 last patched?"_

### Patch Health

| Status | Meaning | Risk |
|--------|---------|------|
| Updated in last 30 days | Healthy | Low |
| No updates in 60+ days | Warning | Medium |
| No updates in 90+ days | Critical | High — missing security patches |

{: .important }
> Servers without recent patches are a security risk. Check the Windows Update service if patches are overdue.
