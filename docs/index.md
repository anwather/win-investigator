## The Simple Way vs. The Old Way

### ❌ The Old Way (Manual)

You: _"Why is server01 slow?"_

```powershell
$session = New-PSSession -ComputerName server01 -UseSSL
Invoke-Command $session { Get-Process | Sort-Object -Property CPU -Descending | Select-Object -First 10 }
Invoke-Command $session { Get-CimInstance Win32_PerfFormattedData_PerfProc_Process ... }
Invoke-Command $session { Get-WmiObject Win32_LogicalDisk ... }
# ... more commands ...
```

After 20 minutes: You have raw data but no insights.

### ✅ The Win-Investigator Way

You: _"server01 is slow — what's using the CPU?"_

```bash
gh copilot
? "server01 is slow — what's using the CPU?"
```

Win-Investigator:

```
🔴 CPU Spike — Process Analysis
  - explorer.exe: 45% CPU (Windows Explorer stuck scanning network)
  - svchost.exe: 28% CPU (Windows Update indexing)
  - sqlserver.exe: 18% CPU (normal operation)

💡 Action: Kill explorer.exe and restart Windows Update service

Next steps: Check Task Manager for explorer.exe handle locks
```

**Time:** 30 seconds. Actionable insights included.

## Quick Example

```bash
copilot "What's going on with server01?"
```

```
